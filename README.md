# BRPTGuide
How-to-guide, user manual, and miscellaneous files to construct BRPT (Blue Robotics Pressure and Temperature) instruments for measuring water temperature (C) and pressure (mbar). The BRPT samples at a rate of ~16 Hz and may be deployed (in its current design) for a period of 4-10 days (depending on battery capacity and environmental conditions) in up to 10 m of water depth.
