ParseArchive.bat is a batch file that will perform conversion of STTP 
archives into timestamped-line output without having to use the Windows
command prompt.

Update the PATH line in ParseArchive.bat to point to the location of sttp.exe.
Then drag a time-tagged archive onto the batch file and an output file with the 
same name plus '_out.txt' appended will be created.
