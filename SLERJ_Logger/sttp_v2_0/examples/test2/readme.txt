The source data, test.dat, is a series of test data lines that were
transmitted to the SSR at 1200 baud so that approximately 4 lines are
received per second.  This is to simulate a 4 Hz data source.  The
data was recorded by the SSR into a time tagged archive.

The batch file test.bat generates several output files, each to demonstrate
a different set of options for the new decimating feature of STTP.
See the comments in the batch file for details.
