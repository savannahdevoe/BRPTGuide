from a time-tagged archive.  See the coments in test.bat for details.

test.bat      - batch file to generate test_out.txt from c1214736.dat
test.dat      - data transmitted to the SSR Logger
c1214736.dat  - time tagged archive recorded by the SSR Logger
test_out.txt  - timestamped line output
